üìù Project Description
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of The Coca-Cola Company, focusing on its financial performance, product sales, and regional growth using Power BI as the primary business intelligence tool. The analysis is powered by structured data from an Excel dataset (Power BI Dataset vF.xlsx) and visualized through an interactive Power BI report (1 PROGRAM.pbix).
The objective is to uncover trends, insights, and patterns from Coca-Cola‚Äôs operational and financial data across multiple years. The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly assess key metrics such as revenue, cost, gross profit, operating margins, and net income, while also allowing deep dives into:
‚Ä¢	Product line performance (e.g., Sparkling, Still, Water, Juices)
‚Ä¢	Geographic region analysis (e.g., North America, Latin America, EMEA)
‚Ä¢	Year-over-year trends and comparisons
‚Ä¢	Key performance indicators (ROE, EPS, ROA, etc.)
This solution provides a dynamic and user-friendly interface for decision-makers to explore Coca-Cola's business health, compare segments, and identify opportunities for growth and optimization.
